	  This functionality has been extracted from the Grsecurity patchset.  All
	  creidt for this functionality should be attributed to Open Source Security, inc.
	  The extraction of this feature was from the open source test patch for kernel version 
	  4.9.24.

          If you say Y here, attempts to bruteforce exploits against forking
          daemons such as apache or sshd, as well as against suid/sgid binaries
          will be deterred.  When a child of a forking daemon is killed by PaX
          or crashes due to an illegal instruction or other suspicious signal,
          the parent process will be delayed 30 seconds upon every subsequent
          fork until the administrator is able to assess the situation and
          restart the daemon.
          In the suid/sgid case, the attempt is logged, the user has all their
          existing instances of the suid/sgid binary terminated and will
          be unable to execute any suid/sgid binaries for 15 minutes.

          It is recommended that you also enable signal logging in the auditing
          section so that logs are generated when a process triggers a suspicious
          signal.
          If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
          "deter_bruteforce" is created.
